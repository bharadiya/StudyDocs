//int[] a=new int[5];:>>new keyword is responsible allocating memory for object in RAM.
//int[] a=new [5]int;:>>We can't write like this it is wrong 
//int i=5;
//int[] a=new int[i]; it is allowed we can refer the variable where we store any value
//What is Array?
//Array is a sequence of elements of same type(i.e. int, char, float)
//Arrays are identified by single name Ex.int a[]={1,2,3,4}>>a is a single name 
//Arrays index starts from '0'
//Last element index of array is Length-1
//Arrays are fixed in size means we can't change the size of array at runtime  
//Arrays are objects in Java
//We can declare Array as Ex. int[] a;
//Multiple Arrays on single line is allowed Ex. int[] a,b;
//Ex.int []a,b;>>>Here a: it is Array, b: it is variable becoz there is no symbol attach to it
//Ex. int a,[]b;>>it is not allowed becoz in array after comma JVM expect variable name

//Possible Declaration of Arrays?
//int[] a;
//int []a;
//int a[];

//What is Multidimensional Array?
//It is seen in Tree structure
//Syntax>>int[][] a=new [4][3]; this is how we write 2-D Array

//Valid Declaration for 2-D Array?
//int[][] a=new int[4][3];
//int [][]a=new int[4][3];
//int a[][]=new int[4][3];
//int []a[]=new int[4][3];
//int[][] a,b>>a:2, b:2
//int[] []a,b>>a:2, b:1 dimensional Array
//int[] []a[],b[]>>a:3, b:2
//int[][]b=new [4][];  this is allowed
//int[][]b=new [][4];this is not allowed becoz no dimension is found
