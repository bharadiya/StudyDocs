What is Exception?
Exceptions are objects thrown to the JVM
Every exception is comes at Runtime

There are two types of Exceptions
1)Checked Exception: The exceptions which are checked by the compiler are called as checked exception 
It contains I/O exception,class not found,SQL,NoSuchMethod exceptions
2)Unchecked Exception: The exceptions which are not checked by the compiler are called as Unchecked exception
It contains Runtime exceptions such as Arithmetic,ArrayIndexOutOfBound,Class cast,NullPointer,NumberFormat Exceptions

Exception Handling?
We can handle exception using following two methods
1)try-catch-finally block
2)throw keyword

Difference between catch and finally block?
 Catch: catch block will execute when Exception occurs
 Finally: finally block will surely execute regardless of Exception
 wrap up code will be written inside finally block
 
 We cannot have multiple try block to single try block
 We can have multiple catch blocks in try block but can't have multiple finally block

Throw Keyword:
//throw is used to throw exception object explicitly to the JVM 
//If we want throw a exception explicitly based on some condition then we have to use "throw keyword"
//throw keyword is write inside a method

Throws Keyword:
//with the help of "throws keyword" we can propagate the exception which can occur in our programme
//throws keyword should be write at method level mention in above example

//Customized exception:
//The exception which is developed/designed by programmer is called as customized exception

//how to create customised exception
//1. create a class with customised exception name
//2. extend your exception class with Exception class of java or Throwable class of java
