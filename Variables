//What is variable?
//The something which has ability to varry
//variables are logical names nd they don't have any programming meaning
//int i=10; here int>>is data type, i>>variable name, 10>>Literal/constant
//Syntax>><data type> <variable name>=<Literal/constant>
//variable is name given to a certain memory locations.
//In variable we are going to save a hexadecimal values inside it.
//We can't write variable without data type(i.e.int float )

//Declaration:Declaring to the JVM that particular variable going to hold any value Ex.int i;
//Definition:Ex.int i=10;
//Single line Declaration nd Definition also allowed in Java Ex. int i=10;
//We can write multiple variables on single line  Ex. int i=10,j=20,k=30; no need to write
//Separate int to all variables becoz java can resolved it automatically

//Naming conventions of Variables?
//Variable name should not be same as Java Reserve keywords(byte,int,short,float,class,public...52 to 53 others)
//Variable name should not start with number Ex.int 01i=10; it will show error
//There should not be any special type character except ($ & _) Ex. int $i=10,int _i=10;
//Variable should follow camel case naming convention i.e. 1st char of 1st word is small nd successor 1st char of 2nd word is capital Ex.int firstData=10; 
//Single quotes('') are reserved for characters
//Double quotes("") are reserved for Strings
