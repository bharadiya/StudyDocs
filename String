String Buffer:
//String buffer will print Ram Sawai becoz sb is mutable
//objects of String buffer is Synchronized becoz at a time it focus on only one thread
//It is synchronized becoz all the methods have keyword synchronized
//if there is multithreaded environment in our programme then we must use SB 
//objects of string buffer is thread safe		
//performance wise it is slow	
//initial capacity of SB is 16 characters		

String Builder:
//String buffer will print Ram Sawai becoz string builder is mutable in nature
//objects of String Builder is not synchronized becoz at a time it focus on multiple threads
//It is non synchronized becoz none of the method of string builder is synchronized
//objects of String Builder is not thread safe
//performance wise it is fast

Note:
1)string s="Akshay"; here in this case akshay will save in string constant pool
2)string s=new string("Akshay");here in this case akshay will save in Heap
