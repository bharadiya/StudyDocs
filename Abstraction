//Definition:It is a way through which we will allow to have multiple implementation of same feature
//We can achieve abstraction by using abstract class and Interface

//1.Using Abstract Class:
//In Abstraction we can have both abstract and concrete methods
//Abstract class can have zero or more than zero methods 
//Abstract class can have all methods as abstract
//Abstract class can have all methods as concrete
//Abstract methods can not be Final becoz we can not change it as per our need 
//Abstract methods should have modifiers public or protected only
//Abstract methods should not be Static becoz it will create only one copy so we can't use for more
//we have to write abstract keyword for abstract methods
//We can write instance variable in abstract class
//We can write concrete method in abstract class
//we can also write local variable in concrete method
//We can't write abstract keyword to variables
//We can write abstract keyword to method but we can't give a body to it
//for concrete method we can't write abstract keyword

//2.Using Interface:
//Interface is used to achieve 100% abstraction upto Java version 1.9
//In interface we just have abstract method only
//in Interface by default all methods are abstract
//We can't write concrete method in interface
//We can write concrete method in Java 10 version 
//We can't create instance of Interface
//All methods should be public or protected
